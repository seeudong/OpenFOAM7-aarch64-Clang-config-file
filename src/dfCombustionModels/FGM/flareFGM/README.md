flareFGM –– Turbulcence-Chemistry Interaction Model
==============

Description
--------------
The FlaRe (Flamelet Revised) model is a derivative of the FGM approach, with particular focus on the scalar dissipation rate and statistical correlation modelling. Like other FGM models, a flamelet library is required for the flareFGM model to run in DeepFlame.
